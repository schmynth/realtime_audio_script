Script to apply realtime audio tweaks to arch based distros

This script applies real time audio tweaks as suggested in the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Professional_audio).

It also authorizes $USER to run cpupower without password. I use this in a script that sets the governor to performance and launches my daw. When the daw is closed, this script sets the governor back to powersave.
